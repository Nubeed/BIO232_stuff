vector.SmallLetters.Repeated <- rep(letters, 1:26)
print(vector.SmallLetters.Repeated)

#Question2

#first we have to define the elements.

element.one <- 1:10
element.two <- element.one^2
element.three <- element.one^3
element.four <- element.one^4
element.five <- element.one^5

#Now, we create a list that includes the above elements. 

my.list <- list(element.one, element.two, element.three, element.four, element.five)
print(my.list)

#Question3

#Below, used R's built-in constant which displays month names. 

Months <- month.name

#Below, used the rep function that would display the seasons of months in the city of Lahore.

Season <- rep(c("Winter","Spring","Summer","Autumn","Winter"), c(2,2,4,2,2))

#Below, used concatenate and sample functions to generate average temperatures in each month.
#Each season's average temperature has been sampled from different subranges between 2-40 degrees to reflect reality as much as possible. 

Average_Temperature <- c(sample(2:20, 2, replace = T), sample(12:30, 2, replace = T), sample(25:40, 4, replace = T), sample(15:32, 2, replace = T), sample(2:20, 2, replace = T))

#Below, generated boolean values (True or False) depending on whether it usually rains in a certain month or not.
#In Lahore, it usually rains from June to September during the Monsoon. 

Rain <- rep(c(F,T,F), c(5,4,3))

#Below, created and printed a data frame that includes all the data generated in the above code. 

Climate.Lahore <- data.frame(Months, Season, Average_Temperature, Rain)
print(Climate.Lahore)


#question4

#Below is a construction of three different sub-datasets, one for each group.

Data_ctrl <- PlantGrowth[PlantGrowth$group == "ctrl",]
Data_trt1 <- PlantGrowth[PlantGrowth$group == "trt1",]
Data_trt2 <- PlantGrowth[PlantGrowth$group == "trt2",]

#Below, average weights for each of the three constructed datasets are calculated. 

avgWeight_ctrl <- mean(Data_ctrl$weight)
avgWeight_trt1 <- mean(Data_trt1$weight)
avgWeight_trt2 <- mean(Data_trt2$weight)

#Below, the average weights are printed. 

print(c("Average weight of ctrl group:", avgWeight_ctrl))
print(c("Average weight of trt1 group:", avgWeight_trt1))
print(c("Average weight of trt2 group:", avgWeight_trt2))


#Question 5

#Answer)

#Following code creates a table which depicts the number of entries for each type.

table(CO2$Type)

#Question 5) b) Number of entries according to type and plant. 

#Following code creates a table that depicts the number of entries according to each type and plant. 
#Rows will be named by plants, columns will be named with types. 

table(CO2$Plant,CO2$Type)
